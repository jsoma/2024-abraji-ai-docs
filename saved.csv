Mr. Bailey,

I wanted to follow up with you about the hand piles located on National Forest System lands 

adjacent to Spruce Valley Ranch. The plan is to burn these piles next fall/winter 2015-16 once there is 
snow on the ground. The decision was made not to burn them this winter because of the amount of 
green/wet wood in the piles. Piles that are too green/wet will only partially consume thus leaving  a 
slightly smaller pile of half burnt logs. We tried burning a few green piles this past winter but didn’t 
have much luck. By waiting until next fall/winter to burn them this will make the pile burning more 
effective at consuming the woody material. Similar piles burned in Summit County that had been 
allowed to cure properly consumed 90-98% of the material with very little material left on site. This 
meets the project objective of reducing potential of future wildfires and restoring forest health. We 
recognize the delay is an inconvenience for the Spruce Valley Ranch homeowners but the long term 
results of the project will be better for the forest and the adjacent landowners .   

All the burning will be implemented with experienced firefighters under the direction of a 
qualified Burn Boss. The Burn Boss works with the National Weather Service to burn only on days when 
the smoke gets up and out of the area as much as possible to minimize negative impacts. We will get 
the word out to the HOA before pile burning operations start next winter.  Thanks for your 
understanding. Feel free to contact me at my number below or Ross Wilmore, Fire Management 
Officer, at 970-328-5867 if you have any questions or concerns. Bill

All, 

K-R_piles

Pay Period 3 wasn’t quite as spectacular as PP2, but every pile on our list in Keystone is now gone. We 
also kept burning in Breckenridge; progress is slow, but the Red, White and Blue fire chief told me Friday 
that his residents are very happy to see smoke in the air and piles disappearing. We added 255 piles to 
the count for a total of 2,339 to date; our treated acres estimate now stands at 283.5.

We are still rolling up PP3 costs, but we’d spent $33,238 at the end of PP2 for a per-acre total of 
$140. This is $40/acre less than PP1, and I expect the number to drop further.

We received a smoke permit for the Mt Powell project area today, and we’re hoping to finish those piles 
this week. We are looking to snowmachine into Tigiwon next week; we have about 100 large machine 
piles to take care of up there. We’ll head back to Breckenridge once those are done.

The attached pic from Keystone Ranch is my new desktop background……holler with questions!   ---Ross

Dear Mr. Brown, 

We are writing to you in response to the petition you submitted to the Summit Board of County Commissioners 
on April 14 regarding potential impacts to the Peaks Trail by the U.S. Forest Service’s Ophir Mountain Forest 
Health and Fuels Reduction Project. 

We certainly share your strong concerns for forest health, wildfire protection, recreational resources and wildlife, 
and we thank you for your input on the Ophir Mountain Project. However, we don’t share your view that the 
project’s implementation should be delayed in order to re-evaluate its merits. 

It is our view that the U.S.F.S Ophir Mountain Project makes sound use of the best available science, a solid 
understanding of current conditions and extensive input from stakeholders and the general public to address 
wildfire protection and forest health goals in the wake of the mountain pine beetle epidemic. Representatives of 
Summit County government, including the BOCC, communicate regularly and work closely with experts from the 
U.S. Forest Service, the Colorado State Forest Service, local fire districts, local municipalities and other partners 
to ensure that all agencies’ fuels reduction and forest health activities are carried out in accordance with the 
Summit County Community Wildfire Protection Plan. And we remain confident in the CWPP’s objectives, 
actions, policies and programs. We firmly believe that these objectives, actions, policies and programs are 
essential in protecting lives, property, infrastructure, water supplies, recreational resources, natural resources, the 
local economy and our cherished way of life in Summit County for the long term. 

Sincerely,

The forest has a great opportunity to acquire funding for watershed maintenance and restoration 
treatments with objectives of providing clean water from the Blue River Headwaters. Over the last five 
years, funding was primarily focused on vegetation treatments to reduce the impacts of wildfire in the 
Upper Blue watershed.

Most of you submitted some brief proposals a couple months ago that could potentially be funded with 
Denver Water Board (DWB) partnership money 3026-2020. Denver Water was interested, but not 
committed to the proposals, they wanted more detailed information on road decommissioning, trail 
decommissioning, reforestation, noxious weed treatments, stream improvements, etc.

DWB is looking to fund implementation of projects, not planning (NEPA).

For 2016-2020 proposals, if you believe that it worth your effort for funding, DWB would like a proposal 
(one page or less project description) which includes:

Description of the Project
Where is the project going to occur and what year (created a table with the road #’s, trail #’s, miles, to 
be decommissioned or acres of nx weed treatments). The table should also show what is DWB funded 
and what would be USFS funded (or partner funded).
Why is it needed
How is it going to be accomplished
What are the benefits to watershed health
How are we going to know it’s effectiveness (monitoring plan)
Are there other partners involved
Estimated cost of project
Provide maps of the project (8.5 x 11”). The scale of the map 1:24000 if possible. The maps should 
display the roads or trails to be decommissioned by year (color code it for planned year).

If you can get this info to me by May 28th, I’ll submit it for further review and field trip review this 
summer.

This is a great opportunity to build your program with partnership funding.

Questions -let me know.

Thanks - Cary

pdf-documents/DWB_ProjectProposals_Recreation_5_29_15.pdf,"Forest Service Road Decommissioning 

Project Description 
Six miles of existing roads would be decommissioned over three years.  Road decommissioning 
is defined as: ""Activities that result in the stabilization and restoration of unneeded roads to a 
more natural state.""  The Forest Service identifies six levels of treatments for road 
decommissioning: 

1.  Block entrance (signs, barriers, rocks, logs, etc.) 
2.  Block entrances, scarify, water bar installation and revegetate. 
3.  Block entrances, fill ditches, outslope road, install water bars, scarify and revegetation. 
4.  Block for specified distance, remove structures, fill ditches, outslope road, install waterbars, 

scarify, and revegetate. 

5.  Re-contour for specified distance, remove structures, fill ditches, outslope remaining road, 

install waterbars, scarify and revegetate. 

6.  Full re-contouring, remove structures, and revegetate. 

Why is it needed? 
This project helps to implement the White River National Forest Travel Management Plan for which an 
EIS was completed in March 2011. One of the purposes of this planning process was to identify what is 
not on the official designated travel system and to be able to restore lands back to their natural state.  
Many of these roads were used for decades and are eroding.  They carry water and sediment and in 
some cases, directly impact streams.   

How is it going to be accomplished? 
In each of the three years identified, a contractor with heavy equipment would be hired to 
decommission the roads and close them to public use.  Forest staff would prepare and administer the 
contract.  Hand work would be accomplished using a 10-person youth crew as well as a one-day, 15-
person volunteer project.   

What are benefits to watershed health? 
Road decommissioning is used to reduce chronic sediment delivery, restore hillslope hydrology, and 
reduce impacts to aquatic, riparian, and terrestrial ecosystems of roads crossings. Roads often develop a 
water-repellent soil layer caused by lack of vegetative cover and changes in soil composition. Erosion, 
the formation of water channels beside the road, and increased sediment loads in nearby streams are 
common results of this process. Roads are also known to cause habitat fragmentation for wildlife which 
may alter animal survival, reproductive success, and movement patterns. 

Monitoring Plan/Effectiveness 
The roads would be monitored each year to determine if natural regeneration is occurring in the 
disturbed corridor and to ensure they have remained closed to public use.   If natural revegetation is not 
successful after two years, grass seeding will occur.   

Partners: Potential partners would include Friends of the Dillon Ranger District and Rocky Mountain 
Youth Corps (RMYC).   

Match:  Annually, at least 90 hours of volunteer labor would be involved with the volunteer project.  
This has a value of $2076 ($23.07/hour).  Of the two weeks that RMYC would provide a 10-preson youth 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
crew, one of those weeks would be funded by the National Forest Foundation Ski Conservation Fund 
($6,800).  The match amount is in addition to the funds requested.

Forest Service Trail Decommissioning 

Project Description 
Seven miles of trail would be decommissioned over three years.  Trail decommissioning is 
closing and restoring routes that the Forest has decided to be closed because they are 
unsustainable and no longer needed.   

Why is it needed? 
This project helps to implement the White River National Forest Travel Management Plan for which an 
EIS was completed in March 2011. One of the purposes of this planning process was to identify what is 
not on the official designated travel system and to be able to restore lands back to their natural state. 
Some of the reasons for trail decommissioning are: 

  Closing unsustainable routes that are causing resource damage. 
  Closing duplicate routes. 
  Closing routes that are impacting wildlife habitat. 

How is it going to be accomplished? 
For each of the three years identified, a Rocky Mountain Youth Corp crew would be used to close the 
trails and accomplish the restoration work.  Additionally, a one-day, 15-person Friends of the Dillon 
Ranger District (FDRD) volunteer project would be conducted.  Forest staff would coordinate these 
projects.   

What are benefits to watershed health? 
Trail decommissioning can provide protection to water, stream, meadow and riparian resources. 
Restoration work will rehabilitate the damaged landscapes and aquatic resources to proper functioning 
conditions.   Waterbars or check dams will be installed where needed.  Compacted soil will be scarified 
to promote natural revegetation.   

Monitoring Plan/Effectiveness 
The trails would be monitored each year to determine if natural regeneration is occurring in the 
disturbed corridor and to ensure they have remained closed to public use.  If natural revegetation is not 
successful after two years, grass seeding will occur.   

Partners: Potential partners would include Friends of the Dillon Ranger District and Rocky Mountain

Forest Service Trail Drainage Improvements 

Project Description 
Sections of existing system trail lack proper drainage and are eroding.  Drainage structures 
(waterbars, check dams, drain dips, turnpikes, and puncheons) are needed to deter water from 
running down the trail.  Approximately 60 structures would be constructed over three years. 

Why is it needed? 
This project helps to implement the White River National Forest Travel Management Plan for which an 
EIS was completed in March 2011. The Forest chose to adopt several trails in three different systems.  
Most of these trails were not part of the Forest travel system and were not designed or maintained.  For 
the most part, these trails are sustainable, but contain sections that need maintenance.   

 How is it going to be accomplished? 
An existing agreement with the Friends of the Dillon Ranger District (FDRD) will be used to authorize and 
fund the work.  Three 15-person, one-day volunteer projects will be implemented in each of the three 
years identified.  Annually, at least one wood structure (puncheon or turnpike) and nineteen earthen 
structures (waterbars or check dams) would be constructed.  Forest and FDRD staff would coordinate 
the work.   

What are benefits to watershed health? 
Trail decommissioning can provide protection to water, stream, meadow and riparian resources. 
Restoration work will rehabilitate the damaged landscapes and aquatic resources to proper functioning 
conditions.  

Monitoring Plan/Effectiveness 
The trails would be monitored each year to determine if the structures are effect.  The District will be 
responsible for future maintenance.  For example, as waterbars catch sediment, it must be removed to 
ensure continued success of the structure.   

Partners: Potential partners are the Friends of the Dillon Ranger District and their volunteer base. 

Match:  Annually, at least 270 hours of volunteer labor would be involved with the volunteer project.  
This has a value of $6,210 ($23.07/hour).

I’ve been looking forward to writing this one.

We had some great days of burning in PP 2; we more than doubled our pile count and finished the 
Keystone East project. On Tuesday 2/3, EZ Fire and  a CCI crew lit off a record 636 piles, most of those in 
the Breckenridge Handtreatment 2013 project.  With the 220 we burned on 1/28, we’re up to 835 in 
that project area alone.

Our total now stands at 2,084, with over 300 of those either large hand- or machine-built piles. Our acre 
roll-up is not yet finished, but we believe we have at least 213 acres completed. I will update costs 
when I get those numbers next week.

We were able to use our nonstandard air quality permit on 2/3 and heard no complaints from the 
public. We got one neutral air quality comment from Robin Thoebald (one of our regulars) and will 
respond. Other feedback remains positive.

Questions, holler…..---Ross

The USFS will be conducting pile burning operations in the Barton Gulch and Tiger rd. areas, 
North of Breckenridge CO. The Barton Gulch piles are located in the clear-cuts North of Barton 
RD, west of Highway 9, and Coyne Valley Rd. Additionally there will be a concurrent operation 
in The Tiger RD, and Revett Rd. area. The pile burn will take place starting 1/28/2015 and 
smoke could be visible for more than one day. The weather and ventilation is expected to be 
favorable for the burn and ignition operations will begin around 1000. Smoke will be visible 
from The Highlands Subdivision, Breckenridge, Breckenridge Ski Area, Hwy 9, Tiger Rd, and 
Wildernest Subdivision. With the recent winter snowfall fire danger is low, please do not call 
911.
The purpose is to help reduce fuel loading that occurred during hazard tree and wildfire hazard 

fuels reduction. For more information about this winter’s burn program watch the following 
Public Service Announcement from the US Forest Service and Lake Dillon Fire. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBTQrlaERmw&feature=youtu.be

Mary Flynn will be heading up the Tiger Rd. burn operations; her cell number is 314-606-1294.
Any questions about either burn feel free to call my cell. Thanks and have a good week.

PREAMBLE 
This local annual operating plan is prepared pursuant to the Colorado Statewide Wildland Fire 
Management Annual Operating Plan signed and dated 01/05/15.  The Colorado Statewide 
Wildland Fire Management Annual Operating Plan was prepared pursuant to the Statewide 
Cooperative Wildland Fire Management and Stafford Act Response Agreement (Statewide 
Agreement) for the State of Colorado signed and dated 6/1/2011. 

PURPOSE 
The primary purpose of this Summit County Wildland fire Annual Operating Plan (AOP or Plan) 
is to ensure prompt response to wildland fires in Summit County, Colorado.  The Plan is 
intended to set forth standard operating procedures, agreed upon procedures, and 
responsibilities to implement and pay for cooperative wildland fire management in wildland 
areas within Summit County.  The AOP recognizes the statutory authority and emergency plans 
of the Summit County Board of Commissioners, Summit County Sheriff and Fire Protection 
Districts. It is understood by the signors to this agreement that any resources ordered for a 
purpose other than wildland area fire management through the AOP are the financial 
responsibility of the ordering agency.

Local Response Agencies - Local Response Agencies are entities located within Summit 
County having wildland fire response and suppression capabilities.  Local Response Agency 
rights and responsibilities defined herein are only applicable to those Local Response Agencies 
who are parties to the Plan.   

Wildland Area: Means an area in which development is essentially nonexistent, except for 
roads, railroads, power lines, and similar infrastructure, and in which structures, if present, are 
widely scattered.  

Wildland Fire: Means an unplanned or unwanted fire in a wildland area, including unauthorized 
human-caused fires, out-of-control prescribed fires, and all other fires in wildland areas where 
the objective is to extinguish the fire. 29-20-105.5 subsection 2c, d  

INTERAGENCY COOPERATION 

Interagency Dispatch Center 

Grand Junction and Craig Interagency Dispatch Centers utilize the Resource Ordering and 
Status System (ROSS) to dispatch resources.  

REINFORCEMENTS AND SUPPORT 
All requests for additional resources will be made by the Incident Commander in consultation 
with AHJ representative.   

In the event that applicable ordering procedures are not substantially complied with the costs of 
subject additionally ordered resources shall be the responsibility of the party that ordered such 
resources.  

Interagency Procurement 

Non-federal participants in this plan may purchase fire suppression supplies through Defense 
Logistics Agency (DLA).  Any other loaning, sharing, exchanging or maintenance of facilities, 
equipment or support services will be considered on a case by case basis as mutually agreed to 
by the concerned parties. 

Page 6 of 48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interagency Resources 

All wildland fire agencies are limited by current staffing and funding levels.  Wildfire is normally a 
seasonal event in Colorado and as such, firefighting capability will vary by time of year. 

Resources available for wildland fire suppression and support are listed on Cooperative 
Resource Rate Forms, attached as part of the Mobilization Guide, EXHIBIT B. 

Cooperator equipment availability status for out of county is maintained in ROSS.  Cooperators 
may “self-status” in ROSS by requesting a password from Grand Junction Interagency Dispatch 
Center 970-257-4800.   

Grand Junction Interagency Dispatch Center (GJC) will continue to dispatch wildland fire 
resources for out of county assignments utilizing ROSS.  Cooperators are responsible to 
maintain and update the status of their resources in ROSS. 

Standards 

The National Incident Management System (NIMS), including the Incident Command System 
(ICS), will be utilized on all wildland fires.  All extended attack multi-jurisdictional incidents will 
utilize Unified Command.  Under Unified Command affected AHJ will provide on scene 
representation.  These designated representatives will communicate direction and objectives to 
ONE Incident Commander who is best suited to serve in this capacity and has no collateral 
duties.   

Unified Command should be used, as appropriate whenever multiple jurisdictions are involved.  
If there is a question about jurisdiction fire managers should mutually decide and agree on the 
command structure as soon as they arrive on the fire; Agency Administrators should confirm this 
decision as soon as possible.  Once this decision has been made, the incident organization in 
use should be relayed to all units on the incident as well as dispatch centers.  In all cases, the 
identity of the IC must be made known to all fireline and support personnel. 

The incident will have an operations section chief to implement strategy and tactics.  Operations 
should be the person available on-scene with the most fireline operations experience.  All 
requests for fire information will be approved by the incident commander utilizing a single fire 
information officer. 

An Incident Management Team (IMT) is a pre-established team of incident managers from 
various agencies.    The IMT may be used as a support group by the Jurisdictional Agency to 
assist with logistical, financial and planning functions of the incident and when properly qualified, 
operational and command functions.  The IMT may assume responsibility for the fire upon the 
mutual written agreement between the Jurisdictional Agency and the IMT incident commander.  
The IMT may request a UCR liaison with Type 3 incident commander qualifications for County 
jurisdiction fires.  Likewise UCR may request a command level liaison from the appropriate fire 
protection district for federal jurisdiction fires.  

Traffic control will be coordinated by the appropriate law enforcement agency, upon request, to 
expedite the routing of vehicles to and from major fires and to exclude unauthorized personnel 
from the fire area. 

Page 7 of 48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to altered fuel conditions, personnel operating within the bark beetle environment should be 
aware of the imminent danger presented by dead and dying trees, falling at an increasing rate 
across a broad forested landscape.   The USFS-R2 Fire Operations Guidance in Bark Beetle 
Stands is in Exhibit D. 

An After-action-review (AAR) of events and actions taken by suppression forces during wildland 
fires will be conducted by the AHJ commensurate with the complexity of the incident. 

Each party is responsible for inspecting its own equipment annually for use and road worthiness 
prior to listing it as available for interagency use with Grand Junction or Craig Interagency 
Dispatch Centers. 

PREPAREDNESS 

Protection Planning 

Summit County, in coordination with Fire Districts, other Jurisdictional Agencies, and 
Stakeholders, has developed the Summit County Community Wildfire Protection Plan to 
prioritize and guide wildland fire mitigation efforts, the terms and conditions of which are hereby 
incorporated by this reference. 

Protection Areas and Boundaries 

Jurisdictional Agency boundary lines between Summit County (private and state lands), USFS 
and BLM lands (Jurisdictional Boundaries) are defined by and shown on the White River 
National Forest map.  Fire District boundaries (District Boundaries) are defined by and shown 
on the District Boundaries map, EXHIBIT A. 

Methods of Fire Protection and Suppression 

INITIAL INCIDENT COMMAND RESPONSIBILITY 

The first fire response agency to arrive at the scene of a wildland fire, regardless of whether the 
incident occurs within its jurisdiction, shall act as incident commander and be responsible for the 
initial emergency action necessary to control the wildland fire or to protect life or property until 
the emergency response agency that has jurisdiction over the incident site arrives. 

CHIEF OF FIRE DISTRICT/DEPARTMENT RESPONSBILITY 

The Chief of the Fire Department in each Fire Protection District in the state is responsible for 
the management of wildland fires that occur within the boundaries of his or her district and that 
are within the capability of the Fire District to control or extinguish in accordance with the 
provisions of section 32-1-1002 (3) (a), C.R.S. 

The Fire Chief may utilize mutual aid agreements and unified command with the Sheriff and 
neighboring Fire Protection Districts to suppress and control fires that cross or threaten to cross 
the boundaries of the district. 

Page 8 of 48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
The Fire Chief may transfer any duty or responsibility the Fire Chief may assume under this 
section to the County Sheriff with the concurrence of the Sheriff. 

The Fire Chief shall not seek reimbursement from the County for expenses incurred by the 
District for their own apparatus, equipment, and personnel used in containing or suppressing a 
wildland fire occurring on private property within the boundaries of the District. 

SUMMIT COUNTY SHERIFF RESPONSIBILITY 

The Sheriff is the Fire Warden of the county and is responsible for the planning for, and the 
coordination of, efforts to suppress wildland fires occurring in the unincorporated area of the 
county outside the boundaries of a Fire Protection District or that exceed the capabilities of the 
Fire Protection District to control or extinguish in accordance with the provisions of section 30-
10-512, C.R.S. 

In the case of a wildland fire that exceeds the capabilities of the Fire Protection District to control 
or extinguish and that requires mutual aid and outside resources, the Sheriff shall direct a 
unified command be established to provide the command and management required to manage 
the fire. Upon the transfer of fire management from the Fire District to the Sheriff, the Sheriff 
shall upon said transfer assume financial responsibility for firefighting efforts on behalf of the 
county and the authority for the ordering and monitoring of resources.   

In the case of a wildland fire that exceeds the capability of the county to control or extinguish, 
the Sheriff shall be responsible for seeking the assistance of the state, by requesting assistance 
from the DFPC. The Sheriff and the Director of DFPC shall enter into an agreement concerning 
the transfer of authority and responsibility for fire suppression and the retention of 
responsibilities under a unified command structure. 

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY 
DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITY 

The DFPC shall be the lead state agency for wildland fire suppression as identified in the 
Colorado State Emergency Operations Plan and in accordance with the provisions of section 24 
-33.5 -1201, C.R.S. 

The DFPC may provide land management and wildland fire management services to other state 
agencies by means of memoranda of understanding or related forms of cooperative 
agreements. 

In case of a wildland fire that exceeds the capability of the county to control or extinguish, the 
DFPC may assist the Sheriff in controlling or extinguishing such fires, and may assume 
command of such incidents with the concurrence of the Sheriff under a unified command 
structure.

The Colorado Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (DHSEM) shall 
be the lead state agency for consequence management and for resource mobilization as 
identified in the Colorado Resource Mobilization Plan in accordance with the provisions of 
section 24-33.5-702 and 24-33.5-705.3. CRS.  

Resource Mobilization will be coordinated between the GJC, the Incident Logistics, the 
Colorado Division of Emergency Management and Summit County Office of Emergency 
Management (SC-OEM). The process for this is generally described on P.15 in the AOP. 

UPPER COLORADO RIVER and NORTHWEST COLORADO INTERAGENCY FIRE 
MANAGEMENT UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES 

The UCR and NWCFMU are responsible for managing fires occurring on National Forest lands 
and lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management.  BLM lands in Summit County are 
administered by the BLM-Kremmling Field Office. 

REPAIR OF WILDLAND FIRE SUPRESSION DAMAGE 

Repair of wildland fire suppression damage is the responsibility of the jurisdictional 
agency/agencies or landowner unless otherwise agreed to by the unified command group.  
Rehabilitation is not covered under EFF.  It may be authorized by the DFPC Agency 
Administrator only when part of the Incident Action Plan during the EFF period. 

Repair of wildland fire suppression damage on Denver Water (DW) and Colorado Springs 
Utilities lands (CSU) is the responsibility of DW and or CSU, unless otherwise agreed to by the 
unified command at the time of fire close out.  All efforts will be made by agencies involved in 
suppressive action to minimize damage through the use of “MIST”, or through rehabilitation 
activities conducted at the time of the incident.  Examples of these rehabilitation activities would 
include: water barring firelines; placement of logs or rocks across firelines; spreading slash 
across heavily disturbed areas, etc. 

Reciprocal (Mutual Aid) Fire Assistance 

Mutual Aid is a written agreement between or among federal, state, and local agencies in which 
the agencies agree to assist one another upon request by furnishing such resources as 
personnel and equipment. 

The parties hereto respectively pledge their good faith in attempting to assist each other based 
on their needs, requests for mutual aid, and the circumstances of a wildland fire.  Each party will 
take appropriate actions to include the suppression and/or management of all wildland fires 
during the Mutual Aid Time Period and thereafter, and agrees the primary concern is the 
appropriate management of wildland fires, and none will delay appropriate management efforts 
while deciding ultimate responsibility and/or cost share for such fires.

Mutual Aid Time Period   

  Mutual Aid between the County and Fire Districts lasts for the duration of the subject fire 

event.   

  Mutual Aid between all other parties hereto shall (1) Not exceed 24 hours, and (2) Will 
end at midnight of the first burn period when the Incident Commander determines that 
the fire cannot be controlled within 24 hours of the initial ignition 

County-wide Mutual Aid  

Mutual Aid has been established county-wide without regard to Jurisdictional Boundaries or 
District Boundaries.  Agencies are responsible for their own costs during the Mutual Aid Time 
Period. It is understood that no party to this Plan shall be required to make resources or 
assistance available to the requesting party if by so doing would impair the party’s ability to 
provide effective emergency services within its own Jurisdictional or District Boundaries.  The 
level of activity or involvement by assisting AHJ and/or Fire Districts making a response may 
vary.  At a minimum, parties responding outside of their respective Jurisdictional or District 
Boundaries will send such personnel and equipment necessary to size-up the fire and report the 
situation to the Jurisdictional Agency (ies) within whose Jurisdictional Boundaries the subject 
wildland fire is located. Upon arrival, the Initial Attack Incident Commander will determine legal 
description and the need for appropriate jurisdictional fire investigator. Each AHJ is responsible 
for providing worker’s compensation insurance for its own personnel. 

Mutual Aid Resources: The BLM Type 3 helicopter stationed in Rifle is considered a mutual 
aid resource, and if not assigned to another fire, is available without charge to county fire 
agencies for the mutual aid period (24 hr. after initial report of the fire, unless ended earlier). 
Any federal resources positioned within the UCR are considered mutual aid, with the exception 
of large or very large air tankers, the Type 1 helicopter, and smokejumpers. 

All State resources including engines and helicopters positioned in the UCR are considered 
mutual aid, with the exception of DFPC SEAT’s and State Department of Corrections Inmate 
Crews (Juniper Valley Type 2 Crews).  

Severity Resources: Severity Resources of the UCR and CRC will be available for mutual aid 
response.  This does not include smoke jumpers, “Large or Very Large” air tankers or heavy 
helicopters.  

EXHIBIT B lists mutual aid resources available from cooperating agencies.

Joint Projects and Project Plans 

The Parties to this Agreement may jointly conduct cooperative projects, within their authority 
and as authorized by law, to maintain or improve their fire management services and activities.  

Fire Prevention 

Distribution of fire prevention materials will be handled by each individual agency.  Coordinated 
program delivery is suggested during fire prevention week, open houses, and other local events.  
Page 11 of 48 

 
 
 
 
Each agency will prepare press releases according to their own prevention plans.  Joint press 
releases and coordination with cooperating agencies is suggested to prevent a conflict in 
released material.  Coordination will take place before any AHJ issues a burning restriction or 
ban.  Summit County Wildfire Council coordinates information and education related to wildland 
fire. 

Jurisdictional Fire Restrictions 

The purpose of fire restrictions is to reduce the risk of human caused fires during high fire 
danger and/or burning conditions, and for the protection of human life and property. Fire 
restrictions and closures are invoked on federal, state, county, and private lands under federal, 
state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations. Cooperating agencies should coordinate 
prevention efforts to provide uniform and consistent information to the public. News releases 
should be coordinated to prevent duplication, maintain a consistent message to the public, and 
reduce costs. 

Restrictions governing use of open fires during hazardous periods may be made to include all 
lands in Summit County.  The Sheriff, Fire Districts, UCR and NWCFMU will confer prior to 
implementing fire restrictions to determine the scope of restrictions and a plan for public 
notification and enforcement.  A process flow chart is attached as EXHIBIT F to guide 
interagency implementation of fire restrictions and rescinding fire restrictions.  Adherence to this 
process is strongly encouraged, but it is understood that circumstances could arise making it 
necessary for a AHJ to this agreement to deviate from the process.  Agencies are encouraged 
to specify the lands that are encompassed by restrictions and to implement and rescind 
restrictions at the same time.  

In the case of any restrictions on burning or public movements because of extreme fire danger, 
either by Governor's proclamation or by local issue, the county sheriff will be responsible for 
enforcement on all non-federal lands, and may assist on federal lands at the request of the 
appropriate agency. 

Nothing in this AOP shall be interpreted as a waiver of any party’s statutory authority with 
respect to declaring, regulating, implementing, enforcing or rescinding fire restrictions. 

Burning Permits 

Local fire chiefs have the responsibility of issuing burning permits in their respective Fire 
Districts.  The burning permit shall require the holder to notify SCCC of controlled burning on 
private land prior to ignition.  All pertinent State regulations will be followed. 

Prescribed Fire (Planned Ignitions) and Fuels Management 

The parties to this Plan will cooperate in the development and implementation of prescribed 
burning programs and projects including planned ignitions, and modified control strategies and 
tactics applied to fires within remote areas.  Summit County has developed the Summit County 
Community Wildfire Protection Plan to prioritize and guide wildland fire mitigation efforts on 
federal and private lands. 

Wildland fires resulting from escaped prescribed fires ignited by a party to this Plan shall be the 
Page 12 of 48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
responsibility of that party.  The party responsible for the prescribed fire will reimburse other 
parties to this Agreement consistent with the terms and conditions contained herein for costs 
incurred in suppression of such fires. 

If parties to this Plan conduct a cooperative prescribed fire, details covering cost sharing, 
reimbursement, and responsibility for suppression costs, should it escape, shall be agreed upon 
and documented in the burn plan. 

Smoke Management 

All prescribed fire and fires managed for multiple objectives will conform to the state standards 
to minimize emissions using all available methods that are feasible and economically 
reasonable in order to minimize the impact or reduce impacts of air quality standards and 
visibility goals. 

Smoke permits are under the jurisdiction of the State Department of Public Health and 
Environment.  DFPC follows state and federal regulations managed by the Colorado Air 
Pollution Control Division.  Federal agencies as parties to this AOP will follow state and federal 
regulations managed by the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division.   

Fire managers will inform the general public of the status on wildland and prescribed fires 
through local press, radio and television to increase public awareness. 

OPERATIONS 

Fire Notifications 

Fire Districts making initial attack on fires outside their District Boundaries will ensure, through 
SCCC, that the jurisdictional agency is promptly notified.  The initial attack Incident Commander 
is responsible for ensuring that SCCC notifies GJC or CRC of all fires reported on federal lands.  
The actual size up report for fires on federal lands should be made by the initial attack Incident 
Commander directly to GJC or CRC.   

Denver Water Board and Colorado Springs Utilities: It shall be the responsibility of 
responding Fire Districts to ensure the SCCC notifies the DFPC if Denver Water Board or 
Colorado Spring Utilities lands are suspected to be involved or threatened.   

Denver Water Board Notifications: When a wildfire occurs on lands owned by DW, the DFPC 
Regional FMO or designee must be notified either directly or via the State of Colorado 
Emergency Operations Line 303-279-8855 as soon as practical of all fires occurring on lands 
belonging to the Denver Water Board (DW). DFPC will notify DW Dispatch at 303-628-
6801 who will make the appropriate contacts. 

SCCC or GJC/CRC must notify DFPC when 1) non-federal wildland fire escapes initial attack, or 
2) threatens structures, or 3) air resources are ordered for non-federal suppression efforts.  

Colorado Springs Utilities Notifications: Primary notification regarding wildfire threatening 

Page 13 of 48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Utilities properties and/or raw water collection system infrastructure: Colorado Springs Utilities 
Dispatch (24 hours): 719-668-8800  

Contingency notification regarding wildfire threatening Utilities properties and/or raw water 
collection system infrastructure: Colorado Springs Utilities, Catamount Wildland Fire Team 
Chief, Mike Myers Mobile (work): 719-491-0753; (personal) 719-332-3088 Office: 719-668-8766 

Summit County Communications Center (SCCC) will receive fire reports from the public and will 
notify the applicable agencies.  These are: the closest Fire Districts, Grand Junction and Craig 
Interagency Dispatch centers (GJC/CRC), and SCSO.  Local UCR personnel may be monitoring 
SCCC but will be officially notified through GJC or CRC.  All sightings of actual or suspected 
wildland fires by each agencies personnel will be reported to SCCC.  All reports of fires received 
by any agency's personnel will be forwarded to SCCC.  The public will be encouraged to use 
911 for reporting. 

Boundary Line Fires 

If a fire crosses, or threatens to cross, jurisdictional boundaries and becomes a boundary fire 
(see definition below) a Unified Command will be formed. The purpose of the Unified Command 
will be to meet as a group and identify one common set of objectives for implementation by the 
suppression forces. The Unified Command may recommend to agency administrators the 
reimbursement responsibilities and resource sharing between the agencies. No party should 
delay suppression efforts while deciding jurisdictional responsibilities for fires in which 
suppression is the appropriate response. 

The Unified Command will include representatives from those entities that have financial 
responsibilities for the fire. In the event of a fire burning on lands of two or more jurisdictional 
agencies that are normally not dispatched by the same dispatch center, the Unified Command 
will coordinate and determine which dispatch center will do all dispatching. 
Boundary Fires include: 

• A fire burning in two or more agency jurisdictions, or will soon burn across the 
boundary, when the boundary line is known 
• The fire location is known, but the jurisdictional boundary on the ground is unknown, or 
• The location of a reported fire is uncertain in relation to the jurisdictional boundary. 

Response to Wildland Fire 

County-wide initial attack  

The closest forces of the parties hereto should be dispatched without regard to Jurisdictional or 
District Boundaries.  Parties hereto will initiate appropriate management activities on wildland 
fires regardless of Jurisdictional or District Boundaries when it is within their capability to do so.  
Local Response Agencies will not initial attack fires if such initial attack puts its personnel at 
unreasonable risk (such as a remote fire discovered at night) or if asked to stand down by the 
Jurisdictional Agency. Local Response Agencies taking independent action should notify the 
applicable Jurisdictional Agency as soon as possible.  The Jurisdictional Agency should assume 

Page 14 of 48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
responsibility for management of the fire at the earliest possible time, or as otherwise agreed or 
provided for herein.  

The Sheriff authorizes local response agencies to respond to private property wildfire outside 
district boundaries (CRS 30-10-512). 

DISPATCHING AND RESOURCE ORDERING PROCESS:  Requests for firefighting resources 
will be made as follows: 

All requests for local non-federal fire resources will be made through the Summit County 
Communications Center (SCCC). 

Requests for assistance beyond the capabilities of local non-federal fire resources can also be 
made through SCCC.  

The SCCC may be supported in terms of resource ordering by SCOEM.  The SCCC may 
transfer their resource ordering responsibility to SCOEM, in the event of this occurring, the 
Incident Commander and GJC or CRC will be notified verbally and in writing.  

In the event the transfer or resource ordering is made to SCOEM then: 
The SCOEM will manage the resource ordering responsibility until such time that a capable 
Incident Logistics Section has been established.  Once established the Logistics Section will be 
responsible for; 
1.    Directly ordering resources that are available from GJC or CRC; 
2.    Directly ordering resources that are non-available from GJC or CRC from SCOEM; 
3.     Reporting to the SCOEM any resource order placed with GJC or CRC that cannot or has 
not been filled in a timely, efficient, or cost effective manner to accomplish the operational 
objectives; 
4.    Reporting to SCOEM for each operational period the resource ordered from GJC or CRC; 
5.    The County EM may establish an EOC as necessary to support and coordinate with the 
Incident. 

Special Management Considerations 

Aerial Retardant Use - The use of aerial retardants on all lands is restricted within approximately 
300 feet of lakes, rivers and live streams and all pre-identified retardant avoidance areas. 

Denver Water Board and Colorado Springs Utilities Lands 
Summit County Fire Districts will respond to wildland fires and follow through on all necessary 
suppression actions on DW and CSU properties that fall within their respective District 
Boundaries. 

The FMO or designee will respond, at his/her discretion, to serve as the landowner's 
representative on the incident and to facilitate possible reimbursement.  

Use of Mechanized Equipment - Use of mechanized, earthmoving equipment such as 
bulldozers, graders, etc., will not be permitted on Denver Water lands without the expressed 

Page 15 of 48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approval of DFPC or Denver Water. 

Repair of wildland fire suppression damage on DW or CSU lands is the responsibility of DW or 
CSU unless otherwise agreed to by the unified command at the time of fire close out.  All 
efforts will be made by agencies involved in suppressive action to minimize damage through the 
use of “light on the land” techniques, or through rehabilitation activities conducted at the time of 
the incident.  Examples of these rehabilitation activities would include activities such water 
barring fire lines and placement of logs, scattering slash and or rocks across fire lines. 

Federal Lands 
Use of roads on federal lands presently closed to vehicular travel (outside of wilderness areas) 
is hereby authorized to all participants of this operating plan as follows: 

Access for detection and suppression is allowed on established roads behind locked gates. 
Access for suppression only is allowed on roads that have been designated as ""closed"". 
Detection and reporting within areas marked as “D-polygon” on the map provided to local 
wildland fire response agencies.   

Suppression efforts should not be taken unless authorized by the U.S. Forest Service or the 
BLM Kremmling Field Office. 

Detection or suppression within designated wilderness, wilderness study areas and/or 
""Roadless"" areas, as designated on the map provided to local wildland fire response agencies, 
is authorized as follows: 

1.   The use of mechanized equipment (vehicles, chainsaws, pumps, etc.) within wilderness 

areas is prohibited, unless specifically authorized by USFS. 

2.   Non-mechanized detection and suppression efforts are authorized in those portions of 

wilderness areas that are not part of a “D polygons” area. 

3.   Detection and reporting only is authorized within Wilderness Areas that are also within a 
“D polygon” area.  Natural ignitions in these areas will be evaluated for, and may be 
managed for multiple management objectives. 

Decision Process 

Federal agencies are required to complete a Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS) 
decision document on all fires on federal lands that escape initial attack.  

A Decision Support System (DSS) may be completed for fires that have the potential to be 
designated as an EFF fire or that affects multiple jurisdictions and has the potential to go into 
extended attack.  DFPC may assist with a non-EFF DSS, but has no authority to sign on non-
EFF fires.   

All agencies involved in extended attack on private and state lands will provide input to the 
DSS.  The DFPC Line Officer will facilitate completion and review of the DSS for these fires.   

Page 16 of 48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When a fire is burning on or threatens to burn on multiple jurisdictions, one DSS should be 
prepared that considers all jurisdictions and their interests.  
DFPC requires that an Emergency Fire Fund Analysis Form (DFPC-#1, see EXHIBIT C) be 
prepared on all non-federal fires, including fires on DW or CSU lands, that have the potential to 
exceed County control capabilities.  The County Sheriff, or his designee, should use this form to 
help determine if a fire might be eligible for EFF designation. 

Cooperation 

Summit County Building Code adoption of the International Residential Building Code, chapter 
45 (local amendment), requires wildland fire hazard mitigation for new construction in 
subdivisions with a wildland fire hazard rating of moderate or high.  Colorado State Forest 
Service assigns each new subdivision with a rating of low, moderate, or high.  Each agency or 
department will provide land use reviews (plat reviews) to Summit County Community 
Development as requested.  Reviewing agencies and departments will keep each other 
informed of findings as they pertain to wildland fire hazards and may when pertinent, coordinate 
reviews of land use plans.  Agencies and departments will coordinate and cooperate on any fuel 
reduction plans or other wildland fire hazard mitigation activities affecting numerous 
homeowners or entire subdivisions.   

Communication 

Program reviews will be conducted at the annual fire operating plan meeting.   

Cost efficiency 

If a fire affects or is likely to affect more than one agency, representatives from the affected 
jurisdictions should coordinate to determine the suppression strategies for managing the 
incident.   

Delegation of Authority 

In the event initial attack is engaged on or near a jurisdictional boundary, the on scene ranking 
officers of each AHJ shall convene as soon as practical following initial dispatch and response 
to the incident, and mutually agree upon a course of action/strategic direction and tactics as well 
as appoint an Incident Commander. 

In the event of an extended attack incident (normally of Type 3 Complexity or greater), a verbal 
Delegation of Authority will be provided the Incident Commander prior to the transfer of 
command and a written Delegation of Authority will be issued to the Incident Commander no 
later than 12 hours after the transfer of command. 

Preservation of Evidence 

It will be the responsibility of the AHJ to take appropriate law enforcement action.  Law 
enforcement personnel from non-jurisdictional agencies may assist upon request from the AHJ. 
The AHJ Agencies will have responsibility for investigating fires and any civil or criminal actions 
taken.  The Summit County Sheriff will coordinate fire investigation for EFF fires.  Fire Districts 
will cooperate with investigations upon request.  Responding units will make every effort to 
identify and protect the area of origin and report all evidence to the Jurisdictional Agency.

STATE EMERGENCY FIRE FUND (EFF) 
Emergency Fire Fund (EFF) Procedures: 
Summit County, Denver Water Board and Colorado Springs Utilities are participants in the State 
Emergency Fire Fund (EFF) with DFPC. As a participant to this agreement, the State agrees to 
come to the aid of Summit County should suppression resource needs exceed county 
capability. Following are the roles and responsibilities under EFF: 

DFPC: For the duration of a State Responsibility Fire, the DFPC shall administer EFF and/or 
State funds for fire management costs and appoint a DFPC Agency Administrator who shall 
represent the State, the County, and the Sheriff in accordance with the delegation of authority 
contained in the Assumption of Fire Control Duty Agreement.  A DFPC representative must be 
on site for an EFF evaluation. DFPC will assist the county sheriff in the analysis of the wildfire’s 
actual or potential condition to exceed the county’s suppression capability. This information will 
be provided to the DFPC Director (or designee), who will make the final decision on EFF 
applicability.  It is the duty of the Regional FMO or their representative to evaluate and report 
the situation to the Director of DFPC and to formally request implementation of EFF.  The DFPC 
Agency Administrator shall work collaboratively with the Sheriff and designees to identify 
concerns or objectives to the Incident Commander within the Unified Command Structure. 

Summit County Sheriff: as Fire Warden for the County (CRS 30-10-513), the Sheriff will 
represent the County in the request for EFF declaration to the DFPC Agency Administrator, and 
any subsequent delegations and assumptions of duty (DFPC #4, #6). The Sheriff will coordinate 
other County entities in his representation. The County Sheriff or his designee is responsible for 
initiating a written analysis of the fire to help determine if a request for EFF implementation is 
warranted.   

Summit County Commissioners: are signatories to the DFPC #3 “Assumption of Fire Control 
Duty” for fires the Director of DFPC approves for EFF. The Sheriff will facilitate obtaining a 
signature from the County Commissioners. Delay in signing the DFPC #4 may result in 
increased costs for the county. 

Federal Agencies: are almost always involved even when the fire is entirely on private or state 
land. Their policies and concerns must be addressed on all fires.  

All EFF fires will utilize a Unified Command consisting of, at a minimum, the County Sheriff and 
DFPC. If land administered by another agency is threatened or involved, that agency will 
provide a member of the Unified Command. 

Implementation of the EFF can be done only by the Director of the DFPC or designee, upon the 
recommendation of the local DFPC Representative, following a request from the County Sheriff. 
For this reason, it is important that the DFPC Regional Fire Management Officer be notified 
immediately of major fires on private/state lands within the county. Should the fire surpass, or 

Page 18 of 48 

 
 
 
threaten to surpass, the ability of county resources to contain it, EFF implementation can occur 
only with a DFPC representative on scene. 

All EFF participating Counties must have identified a minimum county commitment to any 
incident which has EFF potential. This is not a maximum county resource commitment, and is 
not the only resources the county is required to use on the incident in order to request EFF 
implementation. If tactics of a given incident make some of this equipment inappropriate, 
alternate resources or combination of resources can be negotiated. 

The DFPC Agency Administrator will transfer command of an EFF fire back to the county when 
fire spread has been contained, the Agency Administrator’s objectives have been met, and a 
written plan has been prepared for the next operational period. 

Repair of wildland fire suppression damage is the responsibility of the jurisdictional 
agency/agencies or landowner unless otherwise agreed to by the unified command group.  
Rehabilitation is not covered under EFF.  It may be authorized by the DFPC Agency 
Administrator only when part of the Incident Action Plan during the EFF period 

All EFF forms and minimum county resource commitment are shown in EXHIBIT C. 

USE AND REIMBURSEMENT OF INTERAGENCY FIRE RESOURCES 

Cost Share Agreement (Cost Share Methodologies)  

Written cost-share agreements should be negotiated and prepared as soon as practical when a 
wildfire burns across or threatens jurisdictional boundaries, and/or exceeds the mutual aid 
period. 

Costs incurred by an AHJ for services that exceed Mutual Aid fire protection shall be reimbursed 
by the applicable Jurisdictional Agency.  To be reimbursable, services provided by such 
assisting agencies beyond Mutual Aid fire protection must be requested by the applicable 
Federal Jurisdictional Agency. 

Any costs incurred by Jurisdictional Agencies for the initial attack period and beyond, and for 
additional time or efforts which may be requested by the DFPC, DW or CSU shall be considered 
reimbursable, as funds are available, following approval by the DFPC. An agency that provides 
a reasonable initial attack response on DW or CSU lands when the jurisdictional agency is 
unable to respond, may also request reimbursement, from the DW or CSU. 

Cost Share Principles: When fire occurs on lands of more than one Jurisdictional Agency and 
costs are incurred beyond the scope of Mutual Aid fire protection, costs will be borne by each 
agency proportional to the size of the burned area on each agency's jurisdictional area or as 
mutually agreed upon by the unified command.  

When a fire is accepted by the State as an EFF incident, a cost-share agreement may be 
negotiated between DFPC and affected jurisdictional agencies.  The Cost Share methodologies 
may include but are not limited to: 

Page 19 of 48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a)  Each jurisdiction pays for its own resources-fire suppression efforts are primarily on 

jurisdictional responsibility lands, 

b)  Each jurisdiction pays for its own resources-services rendered approximate the 

percentage of jurisdictional responsibility, but not necessarily performed on those lands. 

c)  Cost-share by percentage of ownership, 
d)  Cost is apportioned by geographic division.  Examples of geographic divisions are: 
Divisions A and B (using a map as an attachment); privately owned property with 
structures; or specific  locations such as campgrounds, 

e)  Reconciliation of daily estimates (for larger, multi-day incidents). This method relies upon 

daily agreed to cost-estimates, using Incident Action Plans or other means to determine 
multi-agency contributions.  Reimbursements can be made upon estimates instead of 
actual bill receipts.  

Summit County will be involved in all cost agreements that are expected to be paid by Summit 
County. 

Indirect Costs charged to Summit County by or behalf of the Colorado Department of Public 
Safety for or relating to services provided hereunder, including but not limited to handling fees 
for administering invoices submitted by entities that provided fire suppression and related 
services and equipment, shall not exceed 10% of the direct costs accepted and invoiced. 

Training 

Fire training courses are offered periodically by the Summit Fire Authority, UCR and NWC, the 
DFPC and other agencies.  As these courses or events are scheduled, the host agency will 
notify other Fire Districts and will invite them to participate.  Wildland fire training needs should 
be coordinated through local training committee and the appropriate Zone training committee.  
Trainees/applicants will submit their nominations according to their agency policy. 

The UCR, CRC and DFPC will, to the extent possible, utilize Fire District personnel on 
prescribed and unplanned fires to improve qualifications and readiness.  AHJ personnel will be 
assigned to positions consistent with their qualifications or as trainees for target positions.  AHJ 
personnel are invited to shadow their position counterparts when a local Type 3 or higher 
incident management team is activated.   

Communication Systems  

Federal, state, and county radio systems are largely incompatible and are not interoperable at 
this time; however, all fire agencies in Summit County are equipped with Fire Emergency Radio 
Network (V-FIRE 21) capabilities.  V-FIRE 21 (154.2800) may be used for inter-agency 
communication on a wildland fire if SCCC operations channels are not compatible with any 
agency's radios.   

All agencies to this plan are authorized to transmit on the assigned Interagency Air-to-Ground 
frequencies during wildfire incidents. If additional Air-to-Ground frequencies are required, they 
must be requested from GJC or CRC.  

For the purpose of conducting business authorized by this operating plan, all parties to this 
operating plan agree that assisting agencies may use the jurisdictional agency’s radio 

Page 20 of 48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
frequencies as needed to conduct emergency communications on fires.  No party to this 
operating plan will use, or authorize others to use, another agencies radio frequencies for 
purposes beyond the scope of this operating plan.  See Exhibit B for current Frequency list. 

Fire Weather Systems 

The Grand Junction Interagency Dispatch Center (GJC) will monitor local fire danger levels 
utilizing data from the Soda Creek RAWS and the UCR Timber Special Interest Group (SIG) in 
Weather Information Management System (WIMS). GJC will make fire weather, Red Flag 
warnings, and other fire information available to cooperators via fax and the internet 
at:  http://gacc.nifc.gov/rmcc/dispatch_centers/r2gjc/local_info/index.htm  or  
http://www.crh.noaa.gov/gjt/?n=firewx 

A “Red Flag Warning” is defined by the National Weather Service as the imminent or actual 
occurrence of: 

  Significant increase in surface wind speeds. 
  Dry thunderstorm outbreaks. 
  High Lightning activity level (LAL). 
  Significant decrease in relative humidity. 
  First episode of thunderstorm after a hot, dry period. 
  Any combination of weather and fuel moisture conditions that would cause extensive 

wildland fire occurrences. 

A “Fire Weather Watch” is issued to advise the agencies of the possible development of Red 
Flag conditions. 

Aviation Operations 

AVIATION REQUESTS AND OPERATIONS 
All requests for air support resources will be made to the GJC or CRC.  Risk management 
should be employed when making the request for aviation support and the decision to conduct a 
mission requires weighing the risk against the benefit of the mission and deciding whether the 
risks are acceptable.   

When air support is requested by any agency for suppression efforts, the request must include 
the following: 
Name and agency of person ordering 
Name and location, geographical or township/range 
Type of Air Support needed i.e.  Type 3 helicopter, SEAT, Large or Very Large Airtanker(s) 
Name of Ground Contact  

Additional information that is helpful: 
Lat/Long in preferred datum WGS 84 degrees/minutes/decimal minutes 
Elevation of fire 
Other aircraft in the area, including radio frequencies in use 
Aircraft hazards in the area, wires, low flying aircraft and other obstacles 

Page 21 of 48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Current threats and values at risk  

Personnel whom are ordering aircraft shall use the Air Support Request form in Exhibit E. 

The Sheriff or his designee or local fire protection district/department will notify the DFPC 
Regional FMO immediately when aircraft is ordered for county jurisdiction fires.  

GJC or CRC will make a courtesy call to SCCC and DFPC for all orders of air support 
resources.  SCCC will then notify Summit County Sheriff and local Fire Protection District. 

With the exception of the Rifle helicopter and DFPC helicopters and Multi-Mission Aircraft use 
does not fall under mutual aid described in that section of this AOP. 

LEADPLANE/AIR ATTACK /AERIAL SUPERVISION ACTIVATION 
Heavy air tankers are dispatched with a lead plane when one is available.  Single engine air 
tankers with an initial attack qualified pilot may be dispatched without a lead plane.  Lead plane 
and air attack is not covered under WERF. Anytime heavy airtankers or multiple aircraft are 
ordered an aerial supervision platform will be ordered as well. 

WILDLAND FIRE EMERGENCY RESPONSE FUND 

The Wildfire Emergency Response Fund (Ref: Colorado State Statue CRS (§24-33.5-1226) 
was created to assist local jurisdictions with initial attack wildland fire response on state and 
private lands within the state of Colorado. Any County Sheriff, municipal fire department, or fire 
protection district within Colorado may request WERF as the official Requesting Agency. WERF 
will reimburse, if funds are available, the Requesting Agency the cost of eligible wildland 
firefighting resources.  The fund will be utilized as outlined in the attached WERF 
Guidelines, EXHIBIT E. 

DFPC SINGLE ENGINE AIR TANKERS and HELICOPTERS 

DFPC Single Engine Air Tankers (SEATs) and DFPC helicopters may potentially be pre-
positioned at airports closer to Summit County when a combination of factors or events warrant 
having an aircraft in the area. Requests for pre-positioning will be made by the County Sheriff to 
the DFPC Regional FMO.  Conditions that may warrant pre-positioning of SEATs or helicopters 
include: 
Fuel dryness 
Multiple starts within a 72 hour period 
High occurrence of dry lightning 
Persistent Red Flag weather conditions 
Local resources are occupied with other assignments 
Other factors as determined by the Sheriff and the DFPC Regional FMO 

Billing Procedures 

If reimbursement for any incident is agreed to at the local level, the Fire District may invoice the 
AHJ directly 

Page 22 of 48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If deemed necessary, the County may aggregate expenses incurred by the County and Fire 
Districts to suppress fires on federal jurisdictions and may present an invoice for such expenses 
to DFPC who will then reimburse the County and Fire Districts and subsequently bill the 
jurisdictional federal agency or agencies. 

Federal agencies may submit bills and statements for reimbursements from County and/or Fire 
Districts for federal suppression on non-federal lands to DFPC.  DFPC will make such 
reimbursement and subsequently invoice the County or Local response Agency as appropriate. 

DENVER WATER -COLORADO SPRINGS UTILITIES LANDS 

•  Payment for reimbursable costs on DW and CSU lands require that they be notified of 

fires by the responding agency 

•  Reimbursement for costs incurred on DW and CSU land will follow the procedure 

outlined below: 

•  Payment for reimbursable costs on DW and CSU lands must be coordinated through the 

DW Board or CSU.  Contact DFPC Regional FMO for assistance in preparing 
reimbursement requests for DW or CSU wildland fire suppression response. 

COOPERATIVE RESOURCE RATE FORMS 

Cooperative Resource Rate Forms (CRRF) should be utilized by cooperating agencies to 
document rates.  In the absence of a CRRF, rates set forth in Chapter 20 of the Interagency 
Incident Business Management Handbook will be utilized. Cooperator reimbursement 
procedures, forms, and examples can be found at: 
 http://dfpc.state.co.us/programs-2/emergency-management/wildland-fire-
management/wildland-fire-billing 

Cooperating agencies must have an approved CRRF to be available in ROSS for out of local 
area dispatch. Resources assigned to a state EFF fire from the cooperating agency without a 
current CRRF will be reimbursed using established standard state cooperator equipment rates. 
Cooperator equipment should not be signed up using an Emergency Equipment Rental 
Agreement (EERA).   

Cost Recovery 

REIMBURSABLE COSTS 
Costs incurred by a Jurisdictional or Local Response Agency for services that exceed Mutual 
Aid fire protection shall be reimbursed by the applicable Jurisdictional Agency.  To be 
reimbursable, services provided by such assisting agencies beyond Mutual Aid fire protection 
must be requested by the applicable Federal Jurisdictional Agency. 

Any costs incurred by Jurisdictional Agencies for the initial attack period and beyond, and for 
additional time or efforts which may be requested by the DFPC or DW or CSU shall be 
considered reimbursable, as funds are available, following approval by the DFPC. An agency 
that provides a reasonable initial attack response on DW or CSU lands when the jurisdictional 

Page 23 of 48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
agency is unable to respond, may also request reimbursement as funds are available, from the 
DW Board or CSU. 

Payments for reimbursable costs on DW and CSU lands require that DFPC be notified of fires 
by the responding agency.   

NONREIMBURSABLE COSTS 

The County and Fire Districts hereby agree that each of their respective directly incurred costs 
relating to the provision of fire response and suppression activities on private property in 
Summit County are not reimbursable from or to each other.  

Except as otherwise specifically provided for herein, each party hereto agrees to assume 
responsibility for its own expenses during the Mutual Aid Period.

PURPOSE 

GUIDELINES for EFF 

The purpose of the Intergovernmental Agreement for Participation in the Colorado 
Emergency Fire Fund (EFF) is to: establish the County’s basis for participation in the Emergency 
Fire Fund to provide for payments from the County to the Fund; and describe the conditions 
under which the Emergency Fire Fund will be managed.  

WILDFIRE PROTECTION 

As required in the Cooperative Agreement, the County and DFPC shall jointly 
develop, review, and sign an Annual Operating Plan (AOP) before May 1 of 
each year with all cooperating agencies having wildfire suppression responsibilities 
within the County.  Failure to complete the AOP by May 1 of any year during the 
term of this Agreement shall result in the automatic suspension of the County from 
EFF participation unless the County has requested, in writing, and received approval 
by the DFPC Director, a 60 day extension of the May 1 date to complete the AOP, 
stating the specific reason(s) for the extension.  The DFPC Director shall, in his or her 
sole discretion, approve or deny the request in writing. 

EMERGENCY FIRE FUND 

A. 

The Emergency Fire Fund (EFF or “the Fund”) has been established through the 

payments provided by participating Colorado counties and other entities entering into EFF 
agreements with the DFPC.  The EFF is maintained as an account of Colorado State, under the 
fiscal management of the Director of DFPC. Payments from the EFF account shall be made only 
in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations pertaining to State of Colorado funds, 
including, but not limited to, the State Fiscal Rules. The Director of DFPC is designated as the 
fiscal manager of all such monies received and all interest accrued in the EFF.  No upper limit 
shall be placed on the amount of funds in the EFF, and funds may accumulate from year to year.     

B. 

 Final decision making authority over fiscal management matters shall reside 

with the Director of DFPC on behalf of the Counties collectively. 

C. 

The DFPC shall make distribution of these funds only upon direction of the 

Director or his designee and will be subject to the “Emergencies” provisions of the State Fiscal 
Rules (Rule 2-2).  Disbursements shall be limited to such expenditures incurred in controlling a 
designated wildfire as are within the then-current, unencumbered balance of the Fund. 

F. 

If at any time during the term of this Agreement the EFF becomes depleted, or 
has insufficient funds to meet the expected needs of the Fund, the Director of DFPC will make 
every reasonable effort to obtain additional funds by requesting the Governor to make additional 
Page 37 of 48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
funds available.  Should the Director of DFPC be unsuccessful in efforts to obtain additional 
funding, fire control costs will remain the County’s responsibility. 

 EFF IMPLEMENTATION 

A. 

The County will make every effort to control fire(s) upon non-federal lands 

within the County with resources available within the County.   In the event that the County and 
the DFPC mutually agree that the fire(s) threatens to spread, or has spread, beyond control 
capability of the firefighting resources within the County (as outlined in the County’s Annual 
Operating Plan), the Director of DFPC (or his authorized designee) and the authorized County 
representative shall sign an Assumption of Control giving the Director of DFPC command 
responsibility for the fire(s).  Once command responsibility has been assumed by the DFPC, the 
County shall nevertheless continue to make its maximum effort to provide firefighting resources 
from within the County.   

B. 

When a fire can again reasonably be managed by the County with resources 
available to it, command responsibility for incident management and for payment of all fire 
control costs will be returned by the Director of DFPC to the County.   No expenditures made by 
the County prior to assumption by the Director of DFPC or after return to the County, will be 
eligible for payment by the EFF, without express prior approval of the Director of DFPC. 

VI. FIRE CAUSE DETERMINATION 

A. 

As a condition precedent to entering into this Agreement, and to eligibility for 

continuing participation in the EFF throughout the term hereof, the County agrees that, in the 
event of a human-caused fire, the Sheriff of said County shall conduct an investigation as to 
cause of such fire and will provide the Director of DFPC a copy of the preliminary investigation 
report within 30 days of control of the fire, and a final report upon the conclusion of that 
investigation consistent with State Law. The County Sheriff shall have administrative and 
financial responsibility with respect to the conduct of the investigation.

EXHIBIT D:  USFS-R2 Fire Operations Guidance in Bark Beetle Stands 

Due to altered fuel conditions, personnel operating within the bark beetle environment should be 
aware of the imminent danger presented by dead and dying trees, falling at an increasing rate 
across a broad forested landscape. 
Purpose and Intent: 

Fire Operations Guidance is mindful of Foundational Fire Suppression Doctrine in the Forest 
Service. 

The first principle is: No resource or facility is worth the loss of human life, however the 
wildland fire suppression environment is complex and possesses inherent hazards that can---even 
with reasonable mitigation---result in harm to fire fighters engaged in fire suppression 
operations. In recognition of this fact, we are committed to the aggressive management of risk. 

This guidance provides a collection of potential hazards unique to bark beetle forests, including 
appropriate practices that have evolved over time within the wildland fire service. It does not 
provide absolute solutions to the unlimited number of situations that will occur. 

This guidance within bark beetle stands was provided with the intention of being used in 
conjunction with existing fire risk management documents. No further protocols or rules are 
necessary to make informed risk management decisions for fire operations in bark beetle stands. 
The following hazard guidance is provided: 

Tactical Hazards 
• Withdrawal and/or reassessment should be considered if any of the following are present: 
Thunderstorms in the immediate vicinity. 
Wind speeds are strong enough that canopy movement is observed1 (Consider that wind speeds 
at eye level in sheltered areas may not indicate the much greater winds aloft) 
Reliable communication cannot be established with the appropriate Dispatch Center and remain 
in place 24/7 when resources are engaged. 
Due to limited ingress or egress in remote areas or in terrain without vantage points, consider 
using an aerial platform for risk assessment and size up. 

Potential Fire Behavior Hazards 
Due to increased potential of extreme fire behavior, when ERCs approach the 90th percentile, air 
reconnaissance should be on scene within 1 hour of detection. 
The following situations, though possible on any wildfire, may be accentuated in bark beetle 
stands: 
Accelerated transition to crown fire (when needles are present) 
Increased rate of spread (Surface fire) 
Resistance to control (Heavy dead and down) 
Frequent spotting, including long range ( >.25 miles)

Once implemented, Stage II or III Restrictions will generally not be reduced until fire conditions have sufficiently 
moderated to completely lift all restrictions.

Alli,
Attaching scans of petition signature pages. Collected from couple Forest Health Task Force Meetings and 
couple senior ski trips. No serious effort and nothing formal; as far as I could find out, there is no formal 
petition process at the county level. If the commissioners would like more, we can get them all they want.

On Tuesday, April 14 at the 1:30 public meeting of the Summit County Board of County Commissioners, 
Summit County citizens will present the Commissioners petitions signed by more than 60 people. The 
petitions ask the BOCC to ""request the U.S. Forest Service to delay further implementation of the 'Ophir 
Mountain Forest Health and Fuels Reduction Project' within Summit County, to hold public hearings to solicit 
new evidence about the value of said project and reassess public support of said project and to reevaluate 
the merit of said project.""
The citizens are particularly concerned about the highly popular Peaks Trail and surrounding forest and 
remaining portions of the Colorado Trail on Gold Hill. The Forest Service is now saying that they will complete 
the clear-cutting of this area and the rest of the Ophir Plan this year. The citizens feel that such clear-cutting 
is the exact wrong thing to do on all counts, including fire danger, recreation and tourism and forest 
health/natural ecology. They feel that the Forest Service has not listened to their concerns and that the 
burden is now on the BOCC to protect the county's natural and recreational resources from needless 
destruction.
One of the presenting citizens, Howard Brown, will also speak that morning about forest ecology to the 
breakfast meeting of the Summit County Rotary at the Summit County Community Center.

All,

We had three good ventilation days in Summit County in Pay Period 1 and burned 233 piles, 149 of 
which were machine or large hand piles. We could have burned more on Jan 21 but were limited by our 
air quality permit conditions. This gets us to a total of 954 piles burned for an estimated 133 
acres. Over 200 of those piles were machine-built.

In Pay Period 2 we hope to complete all of the Summit County project areas with the exception of the 
Breckenridge Hand Treatment 2013 project (Tiger Run Road, Breckenridge) and the Mt. Powell Ranch 
salvage project. You may recall that we think the large number of Breck 2013 hand piles might require 
further curing before we can make much headway. Our plan once we’re finished elsewhere is to sample 
a number of different aspects in order to find areas where we can make good progress.   Re: Mt Powell, 
we have not finished planning operations for that area but hope to have it on-line soon. We are also 
making preparations to burn on  the Tigiwon Road (Eagle/Holy Cross RD) when we can’t work on the 
Dillon RD.

By our count, we have spent $24,131 through the end of PP 1, which comes to $181/ac. We continue to 
enjoy good support from both the public and the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division. I did poll 
Summit county/municipal/fire protection district officials on January 15 about burning on the weekends 
and got a pretty lukewarm response. We are leaning away from that idea at this time.

Questions, holler……---Ross

Bill, we have received a request to extend the Mount Powell Salvage Timber Sale contract term to 
12/31/15. This request is being made by the Purchaser, Gary Land Company, to complete the logging of 
approximately 20 acres and the remaining slash work on approximately 50 acres of the timber sale 
area.  They need to extend the contract term into next winter to allow for log hauling across a small 
stream/wet area which can only be accomplished when the area is frozen. We hoped to have this area 
completed early this year but the warmer temperatures have not been helpful. Do you have any 
concerns at this time with extending this contract? I spoke to Cary Green about this request and I 
understand he is meeting with you this morning. Cary can fill you in with the background of the timber 
sale and answer any questions you may have. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks

Subject: EZ Pile burning update PP2 

I’ve been looking forward to writing this one. 

We had some great days of burning in PP 2; we more than doubled our pile count and finished the Keystone East 
project.  On Tuesday 2/3, EZ Fire and  a CCI crew lit off a record 636 piles, most of those in the Breckenridge 
Handtreatment 2013 project.  With the 220 we burned on 1/28, we’re up to 835 in that project area alone. 

Our total now stands at 2,084, with over 300 of those either large hand‐ or machine‐built piles.  Our acre roll‐up is not 
yet finished, but we believe we have at least 213 acres completed.  I will update costs when I get those numbers next 
week. 

We were able to use our nonstandard air quality permit on 2/3 and heard no complaints from the public.  We got one 
neutral air quality comment from Robin Thoebald (one of our regulars) and will respond.  Other feedback remains 
positive. 

Questions, holler…..‐‐‐Ross

Crews to begin burning slash piles in Summit County Monday November 17

Crews to begin burning slash piles in Summit County Monday November 17 

DILLON, Colo. – Smoke may be visible near Breckenridge and Keystone beginning Monday 
November 17 as crews from Upper Colorado River Interagency Fire Management begin 
burning slash piles generated from Forest Service fuels reduction projects.  Ignitions are 
expected to begin around noon and will cease before sunset. Smoke and flames may be visible 
so we are asking the public not call 911 when they see these multiple small piles burning in 
this area. Precipitation, wind, temperature, fuel moisture and staffing always play a part when 
and whether we start burning. 

Burning is scheduled to begin Monday and will continue through the winter months. Be aware 
that crews will monitor the burning during ignition and while the piles are burning hot. 
However, due to the heavy moisture on the ground there is no potential for any fire spread 
and crews will not continually monitor the piles. Specific locations will be identified via 
SCAlert. 

“When we have adequate snow on the ground like we do now with this recent storm we can 
start burning the slash piles,” said Forest Service Fire Management Officer Ross Wilmore. “We 
currently have more than 13,000 piles to burn in Summit County. We like to burn when 
weather conditions are favorable to lift smoke out of the area and moisture in vegetation near 
the slash piles is at acceptable levels to prevent any spread.”

Burning slash piles is necessary to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires entering private 
property from Forest Service system land. The slash piles were piled to cure so they could be 
effectively burned later. 

Smoke from the general area may be seen for short periods throughout the day. Some drift 
smoke could affect homeowners for a short period of time. Anyone with health conditions that 
may be affected by short durations of smoke should contact Lathan Johnson at 970‐640‐9165 
or Bill Kight at 970‐948‐1894. 

The piles will be burned under the authority of an approved burn plan and smoke permit.
